My vision is now normal, but during that time I had a hard time controlling the tip of my brush so that it might be correctly located in space. Also my sense of color was off, as my blood-filled eye changed the tint of everything. But I did not give up, and wanted to show my kids (and myself) that the answer was to keep going.",

Inside the barrel is a 3mm tube of graphite available in a dark 6B softness that pulls midnight from noon and drains the ocean’s depths into a teacup. Hidden inside the endcap is a sharpener. The lead is advanced with a push-activated clutch system. Here I’ve painted a small portrait of the Fixpencil, but instead of using it to draw itself (which felt too on the nose). I’ve rendered it in watercolor using a narrow mongoose-haired brush. Somehow the blue watercolor was a better match for the myth that surrounds this particular writing tool.",
