      "description": "I traveled with my family to Big Sur. We walked along this beach in the early morning. This natural rock formation looked like a door to Poseidon’s lair. I loved the idea that you might walk through it an end up in a totally other world. It felt like an invitation to enter into the unknown, to leave the land of the words and clear intentions and to enter the submerged totality of the senses. Watercolor on paper. 18 in x 24 in",

    "description": "This is a lead-holder known as the Fixpencil. It is without a doubt my favorite way to work with lead. Inside the barrel is a 3mm tube of graphite available in a dark 6B softness that pulls midnight from noon and drains the ocean’s depths into a teacup. Hidden inside the endcap is a sharpener. The lead is advanced with a push-activated clutch system. Here I’ve painted a small portrait of the Fixpencil, but instead of using it to draw itself (which felt too on the nose). I’ve rendered it in watercolor using a narrow mongoose-haired brush. Somehow the blue watercolor was a better match for the myth that surrounds this particular writing tool.",
